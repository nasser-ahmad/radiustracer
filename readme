This softwore is for auditing radius information of all sy isps and store 
information of that in local database

1. prepare an action its job is to add add some information
	to database when receive get request on it .
2. prepare view to search for stored information for all isps
	and display them to the user
3. the information i want from the requst is privatd ip, isp , beside 
	time and public ip which i can extract from the request.
4. so the database should contain fields to store all this infromation,
	id , isp_id , private ip ,inside ip , public ip , timestamp
5. bye


	- ISP: Each isp should has field for ip ranges which will be used like ( isp1.ranges = [range1 	, range2 ....]). Ranges will be migration string field represent the ranges by comma seperated string.

	   . In the isp new page i will put :isp_name as text field , and submit button to create action, with a editable list .




	 For 2-8-2017 :
	 	1. i must change the isp new view ( seperate ip_range control from the isp control will be better idea, so new and edit action will share same form and i should add seperate way to add ip_ranges seperatly ...) 


	for 31-8-2017 : 
	 	1. finishing the authentication and authorization.
	 	2. adding search facilities.
	 	3. ensuring the correct working of all the routes of the application.
